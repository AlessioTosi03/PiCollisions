# PiCollisions
Python script that simulates in a discrete manner the curious and famous "Pi Colliding" problem brought up by mathematician youtuber "3Blue1Brown" on his channel. In this problem, we are "mysteriously" able to calculate Pi just by using two colliding blocks.

"Given two masses m1 and m2, how many collisions take place?"
The straight (technically unproven) answer would be "#Collisions = [π/θ - 1] , where θ = arctan(√(m2/m1)). However we can  compute and simulate this easily, and the short python script does just that: the answer will always have the same digits as π.
